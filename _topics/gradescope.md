The process:

1. Go through and make sure all paper is facing the right way.  Set aside any stapled, paper clipped, or other "odd" papers.
2. Scan papers to a PDF file.
3. Go to <https://gradescope.com> and pull up the course.  Go to the page where you can add an assignment.
4. You will need a PDF of the assignment.  The course page is here: <https://ucsb-cs56-f17.github.io>.  Find the homework, and "print to PDF".
5. Upload the PDF.  Name the assignment exactly what it is named on the course page (e.g. h00, h01, ic02, etc.)

# Notes on giving effective feedback

Be aware that when you write out the rubric items, <b>students see these rubric items.</b>

It is possible to hide the rubric items that are not applied to a student's submission, but Conrad prefers that all students see all of them.  The reason is that the main purpose of the homework is not "summative assessment" (assigning a grade), but rather "formative assessment"--helping students track their own learning, and improve their learning.

That's educational buzzword speak to mean: we need to give rich feedback to the students on what they know, and what they don't know.  We need to help them understand what kinds of answers we were looking for, and why some of the common incorrect answers are wrong.   The rubric on Gradescope is one place we can communicate that.

Another place is via a "summary" that you might post to Piazza after all the grading is done.  Consider making a Google Drive document, or even just a text file in an editor as you go through grading, and then when all is finished, post that to Piazza to help the students study.
