# Suggestions from Dillon Kearns, 12/6/2018

* Teach IDE refactoring
* Teach "Safe refactoring"
* Teach refactoring as part of writing new code, not as a separate step
    * Video: [2 minutes to better code (two hours)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWiwDdx_rdo)
* Mine previous quarters work for examples of refactoring opportunities
   * Show the before 
   * Live code the refactoring.
   * Show the after.
   
* First lecture on refactoring 
   * Dylan: you can refactor without understanding the exact endpoint...
   * Pair / Mob programming.

# Ways of interacting as industry mentor

* Ideally, students will be doing one of the following activities; industry mentors could choose which of these they thing they might offer the most help with, given their areas of expertise.  And/or, students could say where they think they most help.
   * Coding
       * Either refactoring, fixing bugs, or implementing features
       * OR writing tests 
   * Writing or refining user stories or issues
   * Giving demos 
       * Which could be an opportunity to reflect on UI/UX
       * Or on features
