# Suggestions from Dillon Kearns, 12/6/2018

* Teach IDE refactoring
* Teach "Safe refactoring"
* Teach refactoring as part of writing new code, not as a separate step
    * Video: [2 minutes to better code (two hours)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWiwDdx_rdo)
* Mine previous quarters work for examples of refactoring opportunities
   * Show the before 
   * Live code the refactoring.
   * Show the after.
